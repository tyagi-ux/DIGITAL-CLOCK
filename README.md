This project is a Digital Clock Web Application made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It works completely in a web browser and helps users manage time easily.
The application shows the current time, date, and day in a digital format. It also allows users to set alarms, choose alarm names, select weekdays, use snooze, and even add a custom alarm sound. All alarms are saved automatically in the browser, so they are not lost after refresh.
Apart from alarms, the project includes a stopwatch to measure elapsed time and a timer to count down minutes. A tab-based design is used so users can easily switch between Clock, Alarms, Stopwatch, and Timer.
Overall, this is a user-friendly, interactive, and practical web project
